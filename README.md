# Usage:
1. Install python and the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
1. Collect all the KMZ files you want to process into a single directory.
1. Run `python run.py --data_dir [path to directory containing kmz files]`, filling in `[path to directory containing kmz files]` with the path to the directory from the previous step.
1. In the same directory as the KMZ files, there should now be a `processed.csv` file that contains the information from the tables in the KML files.
